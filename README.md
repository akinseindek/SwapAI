Overview
--------

The AI-based Cross-Chain Asset Swap Contract enables users to swap digital assets between different blockchain networks with automated, reputation-aware fee adjustments and cross-chain verification. The contract is designed to be extensible, secure, and user-centric, supporting a variety of tokens and loyalty incentives.

* * * * *

Features
--------

-   Cross-chain asset swaps: Swap assets between different blockchains using cryptographic proof verification.

-   Dynamic AI-powered fee calculation: Fees are adjusted based on AI confidence scores, executor reputation, and chain complexity.

-   User reputation system: Tracks user and executor performance, impacting swap conditions and fees.

-   Loyalty rewards: Users earn loyalty points and unlock tiered discounts based on swap activity.

-   Admin controls: Owner can manage assets, fees, and contract state (pause/unpause).

-   Robust error handling: Well-defined error codes for all major failure scenarios.

* * * * *

Data Structures
---------------

-   Assets: Registry of supported tokens with metadata (chain, address, decimals, status).

-   Users: Tracks reputation, verification status, total volume, and activity.

-   Swap Requests: Details of each swap including initiator, assets, amounts, status, and execution data.

-   User Swap Stats: Tracks successful swaps, loyalty points, and tier progress.

* * * * *

Core Functions
--------------

-   `register-asset`: Admin registers new assets for swapping.

-   `deactivate-asset`: Admin disables an asset.

-   `register-user`: Users self-register to participate in swaps.

-   `create-swap-request`: Users initiate a swap specifying source/target assets and minimum return.

-   `execute-swap`: Executors fulfill swap requests, providing AI confidence score and cross-chain proof. Fees and reputation are updated accordingly.

-   `update-user-swap-stats`: Admin updates user swap statistics post-swap.

-   `redeem-loyalty-points`: Users redeem points for fee discounts.

* * * * *

Loyalty & Reputation
--------------------

-   Loyalty Tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum-unlocked by total swap volume.

-   Tier Discounts: Up to 5% fee reduction for Platinum users.

-   Loyalty Points: Earned per swap and for consecutive monthly activity, redeemable for additional discounts.

-   Reputation: Executors gain reputation for successful swaps, boosting their effectiveness and reducing swap fees for users.

* * * * *

Admin Controls
--------------

-   `set-contract-owner`: Transfer contract ownership.

-   `set-fee-percentage`: Adjust swap fee rate (max 10%).

-   `toggle-pause`: Pause or resume contract activity.
